#Star Particles

Remake of the classic Canvas particles example of when the mouse hovers over particles the dots grow in size. 

I decided to use stars because they were more difficult to draw than dots. instead of changing the radius, I changed the length of each line in the five pointed star and calculated the coordinates using the angles between the lines. 

I also added text to my canvas that is completely responsive to the width of the canvas and will smoothly grow or shrink when the width is changed.
